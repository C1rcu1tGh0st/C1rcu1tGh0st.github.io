## Overview

Warzone RAT also know as Ave Maria is a remote access trojan (RAT) first discovered in January 2019. Warzone RAT is primarily an information stealer but it also comes with other additional features. it is sold as malware as service. the sample is being look at can be found [028c26af36b0a9adf4d1a9c91c2531e28580ebd15d2200fec58c81337813ae56](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/028c26af36b0a9adf4d1a9c91c2531e28580ebd15d2200fec58c81337813ae56/)



## Stage 1 Unpacking

Initial stage comes as an exe, taking a look in Detect it Easy there is signs of [Autoit scripts](https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/introduction.htm), [AutoIt-Ripper](https://github.com/nazywam/AutoIt-Ripper) can be use to carve out autoit script.

*Fig 1:DIE output showing autoit script presence* 

the autoit script is obfuscated, essentially what it mainly does is execute a PE file embedded in resource and craft an obfuscated shellcode and allocates memory in current process and write the payload. they payload can be dumped out by placing a breakpoint on `VirtualAlloc` and monitoring the dump view for a PE file. this PE file is the actual unpacked warzone RAT. the script copies the packed binary into `%APPDATA%/Roaming/aepic ` with name `RtDCpl64.exe` and the embedded PE is copied to `APPDATA%/Roaming/Imgburn` with name `host.exe` the script also schedules a task to run the packed binary every 1 minute for persistence. the embedded PE is executed with name `Blasthost.exe`

# Stage 2 Reversing

Stage 2 is the unpacked payload which is the warzone RAT. the malware set some registry keys values for `MaxConnectionsPerServer` by querying `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Internet Settings` and setting `10` as value.

*Fig 4: setting the registry for max connection* 

The malware now decrypts the config which is in `.bss` section, the config is encrypted with `RC4` algorithm, the data is aligned with the first 4 bytes as the key length which is `0x32`, followed by key, and data

## C2 Config Extractor

the following python script can be use to get the c2 
```python 

import binascii

from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4


def rc4_decrypt(data, key):
    arc4 = ARC4.new(key)
    dec_config = arc4.decrypt(data)
    return dec_config

fp = open('war_04360000fixed.bin', 'rb').read()

bss_start = 0x1c000 #the start has the key length 0x32

key_length = fp[bss_start]

key = fp[bss_start+4:bss_start+4+key_length]
data = fp[bss_start+4+key_length:]
if(b'\x00\x00' in data ):
    endidx = data.index(b'\x00\x00')
data = data[0:endidx]

pt = rc4_decrypt(data, key)

print(pt.decode('latin1').replace('\x00',''))


```
```
*wealth.warzonedns.comRimages.exeÂˆNNO5EEX9Q0

```


the malware creates a folder with name `NNO5EEX9Q0`(from the output of decrypted bss section) in registry path `Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\`

*Fig 8: NNO5EEX9Q0 folder created in registry* 

warzone creates a home directory in `APPDATA/local/` with name `Microsoft Vision`

## Shellcode injection

Warzone creates a process of `cmd.exe` and injects shellcode into it, the shellcode resolves few apis dynamically via api hashing using [hashdb](https://github.com/OALabs/hashdb) it could be seamlessly resolved. the shellcode just checks for process exit code using `GetExitCodeProcess` if it finds the thread is STILL_ACTIVE(0x103) it goes through a sleep loop after the sleep it checks the status again. if thread is not equal to 0x103 it creates the warzone process again. so in a nutshell shellcode just keeps the malware running.

## Initiating C2 Connection

Warzone Setups a socket and connect to its C2, once connected it looks to receive some packets all c2 communication are RC4 encrypted with key `warzone160`, according to this [blog](https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/phishing-campaign-delivering-fileless-malware-part-two) the plaintext packet consist of

* a magic dword `0xE466BB29` 
* size of the command
* command number
* command data


## Commands And Features

each commands is a hex value that is send through the packets and each one of them triggers a specific feature

### 0x2 Get process list

grabs all running process on victim machine

### 0x12 List Cam Devices and 0x14 Record Video With WebCam

Warzone uses COM objects to enumerate video capture devices(Webcam in this case) and use the device to record video. this [MSDN doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directshow/selecting-a-capture-device) is a good read. these are the GUID used to enumerate device.

### 0x28 Enable RDP

Warzone enables RDP by abusing components of [terminal service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1505/005/) it also create a user account with a random name and add this to registry key `HKOM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon\SpecialAccounts\UserList` so the user cannot know that the account has been created.
