## Overview

Spynote is an android RAT that emerged in 2020 it spreads via phishing SMS's the sample[(c19cf001efb893cfb4f3aedb1c4c3771ce8419d3838e1bc399e88a12b583b28c)](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/sample/c19cf001efb893cfb4f3aedb1c4c3771ce8419d3838e1bc399e88a12b583b28c/) appears with name `Android Telegram` and upon running the app it asks the victim to install another app which is a body temperature checking app ðŸ˜‚, the malware comes in packed state with a packer named [Dexprotector](https://dexprotector.com/).


## Manifest 
 
Starting with the permissions the sample does request for malicious permission like `RECORD_AUDIO`, `WRITE_CONTACTS`, `READ_CONTACTS`, `READ_SMS`, `READ_CALL_LOG`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` this app act as a loader for installing an age detector/body temperature measuring app. looking at the available classes in jadx's left pane it shows only 2 classes within 2 packages, a class `R` which is a resource id map and a class `ApplicationC0000a` within package `mph.dexprotect.p000a`(this class name is part of deobfuscation applied by JADX actual name is just `a`) this package name gives signs that its is packed, also in the resource folder path under `/assets/dexprotect` a file named `classed.dex.dat` exist waiting to be unpacked and loaded by making use of BaseDexClassLoader. Looking closely there are other class that are being used but not available in files `com.android.tester` and the main activity is `com.android.tester.C7` but it does not exist for now, the sub class `ApplicationC0000a` is responsible for unpacking this. the packer also offers string encryption, which can be easily decrypted by the python script below.

*Fig 5: packer's string decryption functions* 

```python

enc_str = "" 

def dec_str(string):
	pt = ""
	carr = [12293, 12294]
	for i in range(0, len(string)):
		pt += chr(ord(string[i]) ^ carr[i % len(carr)])
	print(pt)


dec_str(enc_str)
```

malware loads dex file by writing byte from `classes.dex.dat` file to `classes.dex` and later both dir `mph_odex` and `classes.dex` is deleted after loading it.

## Unpacking

Getting this written file can be done by making use of frida script and hooking java `delete` method and logging the path of these deleted files 



```js

Java.perform(()=>{

	var f = Java.use("java.io.File");

	f.delete.implementation = function(){
		var path = this.getAbsolutePath();
		console.log(`deleted path --> ${path}`);
		return true;

	}
});


```

![](assets/ss/spynote/7.PNG)
*Fig 7: path of the written file* 


there are 2 files written both named `classes.dex` to folders `app_mph_dex` and `app_mph_odex` the `classes.dex` file in `app_mph_dex` folder is ELF-OAT(Optimized Android Runtime) 079 for Intel 386 file which is created AOT(Ahead-of-Time) compilation in Android. this binary is more optimized when compare to a normal `dex` file and the other folder `app_mph_odex` has a normal `dex` file, both of the file offers same classes and methods. after getting these file, loading this in JADX gives all remaining classes.

*Fig 8: all remaining class loaded `com.android.tester` package loaded* 

## MainActivity

The MainActivity is `ActivityC0269C7` and it implements a runnable() instance which responsible for installing the body temperature app from `/res/raw/MT_bin` this apk is named as `base.apk` and is most likely a decoy, its the classes in `com.android.tester` package does all the dirty work.

*Fig 10: installing base.apk* 


`OnCreate()` method calls a function called `m1548c` and it checks for if the class `C11` is running as service, if it's not it will start `C11` as service by using `StartService()`

## Setup C2

Malware checks for internet connectivity before proceeding with is malicious intents once the connectivity check is passed it setup the C2 with IP `82.137.218.185`and port `215` once this is setup malware gather basic info like `Build.MANUFACTURER`, `Build.MODEL` etc, it also setup wakelock and wifi lock, majorly it calls a method `c11.b()` which handles all features.

data is exfiltrated to the server in GZIP format, the malware implements a handler to achieve this the below images shows implementation of send wallpaper to C2.
