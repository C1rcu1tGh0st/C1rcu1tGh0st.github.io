## Introduction

In 2024, the Android malware landscape has evolved with the rise of Octo2, a highly sophisticated malware variant targeting mobile devices. Building upon the infamous ExobotCompact family, Octo2 delivers a multi-stage infection process, designed to bypass security layers and remain undetected. Disguised as trusted applications like Chrome or VPN services, the malware silently infiltrates devices, loading a series of encrypted components to eventually execute its payload.

One of the defining features of Octo2 is its advanced decryption process, where the malware leverages RC4 encryption to dynamically decrypt and load its malicious DEX file using the `InMemoryDexClassLoader`. This approach allows it to evade static analysis by keeping its payload hidden from disk. Additionally, Octo2 employs a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) for Command-and-Control (C2) communication, making it more difficult for security solutions to track or block its connections, as the malware dynamically generates new domains for communication.

As mobile banking and sensitive data continue to be primary targets, it's more critical than ever to understand the mechanisms behind Octo2 and take proactive measures to safeguard your Android device from this evolving threat.

For the background on Octo2, the malware is distributed through malware-as-a-service (MaaS). Octo2 builds on the previous version’s capabilities by offering more stable remote access, improved anti-detection methods, and more efficient data theft through credential-stealing attacks on mobile banking applications. Its reach is global, targeting users in Europe, the USA, Canada, and countries like Italy, Poland, Moldova, and Hungary.

The sample disguises itself as `Google Chrome`, and an analysis of the `AndroidManifest.xml` reveals several concerning malicious permissions being requested. Notably, a subclass named `fiucfPresfLh` is present, which plays a crucial role in invoking the native method responsible for decrypting the final malicious payload.

*Fig 1: AndroidManifest* 

Upon examining the subclass `fiucfPresfLh`, it is observed that it loads a native SO file named `kDjLUI` and invokes the method `gfXr4aXHZ4`. This method is responsible for decrypting the subsequent SO file, which contains essential helper functions crucial for the decryption of the final malicious payload

*Fig 2: fiucfPresfLh subclass*

The method `gfXr4aXHZ4` acts as a wrapper function that initializes critical parameters, including the encrypted DEX file path and the RC4 key necessary for decrypting the final payload. Before proceeding with the decryption process, it unpacks and writes a native SO file to disk, named `.r`, at the path `/data/data/com.mfwlantest_launcherga/files`. This SO file is subsequently loaded into memory and utilized to decrypt the DEX file, facilitating the execution of the malware’s core functionalities.

*Fig 5: .r file written to the disk*

Examining the `replace_loader` method within the newly decrypted SO file reveals that it reads the encrypted DEX data file located at the path `com.mfwlantest_launcherga:raw/ctbdotsmbku`. This path is established by the preceding `gfXr4aXHZ4` method (see Fig. 3). The method then decrypts the data, appending a DEX header `dex\n035` to the decrypted output. Finally, the class is dynamically loaded into memory.

For a more in-depth analysis, the encrypted DEX data can be decrypted and appended with the `dex\n035` header before loading it into JADX for reverse engineering. Once loaded, additional classes become visible, further confirming the malicious nature of the file. Notably, critical strings associated with Remote Access Trojan (RAT) features, such as `keylogger_start` and `kill_bot`, are revealed, providing clear indicators of the malware’s intent to perform keylogging and remote control operations.
